# The Problem:

```Markdown
Marketing teams frequently spend hours repurposing long-form articles into platform-specific social posts (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Instagram captions, short-form variants). 
This process is repetitive and error-prone; teams want consistent tone, platform optimization.
Hard to verify effectiveness without data.
Spans multiple systems, with  a need for follow up, scheduling metadata, and/or optional image prompts.
